        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 qt peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>8 chicken tenderloin cutlets</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tsp horseradish</li>
            <li>1 tsp dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>12 slices bacon</li>
            <li>8 plain frozen waffles</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together eggs, whipping cream, cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl. In a paper bag, shake together flour, cornstarch, and remaining 1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>Dip chicken tenderloins into the beaten egg mixture, then place into the flour mixture and shake to coat. Place breaded chicken in a single layer on a wire rack. Let rest for 20 minutes to allow coating to set</li>
            <li>Heat about 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees F. In small batches, fry chicken 5 to 8 minutes until golden brown. Remove chicken, drain on paper towels. Set aside or keep warm in oven at low temp</li>
            <li>Combine mayonnaise, maple syrup, horseradish, and mustard powder in a medium bowl. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a plate lined with paper towels</li>
            <li>Assemble sandwiches: place 4 waffles on a cookie sheet, top each waffle with 2 tenders, 3 slices of bacon, and 2 slices of cheddar cheese. Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until cheese melts. Spread 3 tbsp of the maple mayonnaise on the remaining 4 waffles and place on top of the sandwich</li>
        </ol>
